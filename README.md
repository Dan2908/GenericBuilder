# GenericBuilder Prototype

### Prototype to a building/strategy game system.
This is meant to be a base template to create games that use these functionality.

## Input Mapping
- ASWD / Arrows: Move camera around.
- Q, W: Zoom In, Zoom Out
- Left Click: Select/Build
- Right Click: Cancel

## Tools Used
The assets and UI art are hand made by me, just as placeholders for further real work from any artist that want to collaborate :)
- Unreal Engine 5.2
- Visual Studio 2022 / C++
- Aseprite

### Currently working on...
